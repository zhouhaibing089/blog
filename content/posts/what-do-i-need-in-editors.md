title: "What Do I Need in Editors"

I have been evaluating alternatives to VSCode for two primary reasons:

1. Performance. When I work inside very large monorepos, full-text searches can
   become sluggish enough to interrupt my flow.
1. Curiosity. I frequently see compelling recommendations for other editors, and
   I am generally willing to explore new tooling.

When I survey alternatives, it is easy to disappear into keybinding quirks,
extension ecosystems, and configuration minutiae. Rather than allow each product
to frame the evaluation, I need to reverse the sequence: define my criteria up
front and measure every editor against that benchmark.

### Opening Projects

Editing a single file in isolation is the exception, not the rule. Most of my
work involves entire projects—large or small—with multiple directories and
dozens (or thousands) of files.

When I launch `<editor> /path/to/project`, I expect the tool to surface the
project structure immediately. "Nice" in this context means:

<TODO>

### Multiple Windows/Panels
